[Solar Calculator NOAA Read Me]( index.html#readme.md )
===

## [Solar Calculator NOAA]( http://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/solar-calculator-noaa/ )

Ladybug seeks accurate, fast and verifiable sources for its solar calculations.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is one such source.
Its [NOAA Solar Calculator]( http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/index.html ) has been published and updated for a number of years.

## Original [NOAA Solar Calculator]( http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/index.html )

### Primary JavaScript routine used to perform calculations [main.js]( http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/main.js )

### Solar Calculation Details

* http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/calcdetails.html


### Issues

* Refers to 'azimuth' and 'elevation' rather than 'azimuth' and 'altitude'
* Does not provide negative elevations
* Requires the existence of specific HTML tags with specific IDs in order to operate
	* Too many things like this: document.getElementById("eqtbox").value = ""
	* Makes the source difficult to use generically
* Variable names not coordinated and often devoid of meaning
* Function names not coordinated
* Generally styled and coded in a slightly archaic fashion
* Provides many functions with useful results but provides no easy access to those functions


### Features

* Much simplified version of NOAA Solar Calculator web page
	* Allows data entry and update with a minimal interface
	* helps with debugging
* Loads the NOAA Solar Calculator [main.js]( http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/main.js )
* Displays the name of most functions along with the results returned by the function and and their units
* Results from this script will be used to verify results produced by various Ladybug Web scripts
	* See [Calculations Compare]( http://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/solar-calculator-compare/ )



## Issues/Questions

* The NOAA Solar Calculator code is undocumented
	* Finding sources for the algorithms is not easy
	* Is use of Julian Century now archaic with use of modern computers?
* Is it 'altitude' or 'elevation'; - would like definitive, globally-oriented source/reference for current astronomical nomenclature
* Should all calcs be in radians - might save some conversions back and forth?


## Change Log


### 2016-05-20

* Update readme
* Minor updates
