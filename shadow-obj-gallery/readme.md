[Ladybug Web Shadow OBJ Gallery Read Me]( index.html#readme.md )
===

_Use the menu on the left to call up files and adjust the date and time. Enjoy watching the shadows move as the hours go by._


## full screen: [Ladybug Web Shadow OBJ Gallery]( https://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/shadow-obj-gallery/ )

The idea is to have a core or 'engine' that other scripts - like the one you ae usung now - can call and embed in an `iframe`.
The engine is here: [Ladybug Web Shadow OBJ Core]( https://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/shadow-obj-core/ ).

The calling scripts tend to carry out fairly specialized tasks.
There can be communication between the two scripts when needed.

The general strategy is to be something like node.js or jQuery - a small core that accepts plugins of various types.

Communication between the calling scripts and the core is currently via location hash.
Often these URL strings are called 'permalinks'.

As and when needed it could also be via JSON or even .INI files or - for the fastest operation - via the iframe.contentWindow method.

Currently, the following parameters may be used to control the script.
Only the parameters that need changing need to appear on the location.hash
Designated times for persistent shadows to be added.
Also ability to load multiple projects.
Any others?

* file name
* latitude
* longitude
* year
* month
* date
* hours
* minutes
* placeMap.material.opacity
* project.rotation.x
* project.rotation.y
* project.rotation.z
* project.position.x
* project.position.y
* project.position.z
* project.scale.x
* project.scale.y
* project.scale.z
* camera.position.x
* camera.position.y
* camera.position.z
* controls.target.x
* controls.target.y
* controls.target.z
