We work to make validated simulation engines accessible to designer, engineers, and simulation experts in new ways that have not been available before. We believe you not only need well designed tools but should be in full control of your tool as user. For the last 4 years we have been working on Ladybug Tools. Now we are maintaining legacy versions of Ladybug and Honeybee. We're developing and maintaining Butterfly, Ladybug[+], Honeybee[+], Ladybug for web and we still have so much left to do!

To create a lasting support we started a Patreon page to collect recurrent support. You can support us as an individual, educational institution or a company. This can usually be deducted as a business expense if directly related to your business.

 

If you are only intrested in one-time contribution you can use the paypal link.

 

Your contribution supports Ladybug Tools development, supporting the community, creating teaching resources and will let us to organize community events and programs in the near future.


Thank you for your support!
