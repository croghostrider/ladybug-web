# Services
As creators of Ladybug Tools we can help you to make best use of our tools in your business by providing training, custom tools, workflow development and project consulting.

## TRAINING

From ACADIA to IBPSA conference we have trained designers, engineers and building simulation experts with different level of experties on how to use Ladybug Tools. We create tailor made training material to ensure it meets your needs and the audience. Check our upcoming workshop or hire us for a workshop at your office.

## CUSTOM TOOLS AND WORKFLOWS

We can help you to make custom tools and workflows using Ladybug Tools or other available technologies, or enhance your current workflows so you do not have to worry about them. We have worked on DesignExplorer, EPWMap, Comfort Tool and we can help you to build yours.

## PROJECT CONSULTING

We have used and helped others to use Ladybug Tools in a variety of projects in different scales. In most of the cases we can help you with your question on the forum but in case that is not suited for your case let us know and we can help you as a consultant.

## CLOUD COMPUTING

We are currently in the process of developing cloud service for Ladybug Tools. The service will support daylighting, energy and CFD analysis and is optimized and customized for Ladybug Tools workflows. Stay tuned!

ENERGY + ENVELOPE DESIGN WITH HONEYBEE OPENSTUDIO + THERM

Instructors: Chris Mackey, Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari

The session will focus on building enegy modeling and envelope U-value modeling with the Honeybee plugin for Grasshopper. In the morning, participatns will setup a parametric energy model and use it to perform a sensitivity analysis to inform intermediate stages of design. In the afternoon, instructors will explain the basics of modeling constructino details with Honeybee THERM. Honeybee is currently the only plugin linking LBNL THERM and WINDOW to a CAD interface and so it provides the only alternative to THERM’s own drawing interface. At the end of the workshop, the results of the THERM models will be used to inform the energy models built in the morning.

CLIMATE DATA + DAYLIGHT WORKFLOWS WITH LADYBUG + HONEYBEE

Instructors: Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari, Chris Mackey

The session will focus on creating workflows for several types of sun-related studies using Ladybug and Honeybee. The morning will cover weather data visualizations as participants learn the logic of using Grasshopper and basic principles for generating customized climate graphics with Ladybug. The afternoon will explain the workflows for daylight modeling with Honeybee as participants learn to automate and run more advanced studies. Each half of the workshop will open with a short presentation defining the motivations for running the given studies followed by a hands-on tutorial and design exercise.

An introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics with Butterfly

Instructors: Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari, Chris Mackey

This workshop will introduce Butterfly – the newest addition to the insect community of Ladybug + Honeybee. Butterfly allows one to set-up and run advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations from inside Grasshopper using the validated, open source engine OpenFOAM. It’s recommended that you have at least a year-worth of visual scripting experience for attending this workshop. Grasshopper will be used for the workshop’s hands-on exercises but a number of similar examples and workflows will be shown with DynamoBIM. Prior knowledge of Computational Fluid Dynamic is preferred but not required.

Open data and performance

Instructors: Elcin Ertugrul, Mostapha Sadeghipour Roudsari, Chris Mackey

The workshop focuses on computational tools and workflows for exploring, analyzing and visualizing large, complex and dynamic geospatial data in a parametric visual scripting environment. Through a series of hands-on tutorials, attendees will be introduced to several different methods of quantitative environmental analysis using geospatial 'Open Data' and temporal climate data. Participants will practice different techniques of optimization and solution-finding, such as “brute force and filtering” and “multi-objective analysis” in order to address a number of design exercises presented during the workshop.
