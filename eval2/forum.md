Forum
Currently you should use the grasshopper ladybug forum for Grasshopper related questions and dynamo forum for questions related to our plugins for Dynamo.

Once we reach $200 monthly support we will have enough funding to start a dedicated discourse page for Ladybug Tools on this page. 
See Contribute page to help us reach this target.
