# Our Story
Ladybug Tools was started by Mostapha in 2012 in order to make the process of environmental analysis more integrated, easier, and faster. The first version was released on January 2013 as the Ladybug plugin for Grasshopper. This was a collection of 28 components for weather data visualization, radiation, and sunlight hours analysis. Following the success of Ladybug, Honeybee for Grasshopper was released in 2014 to connect Grasshopper with validated daylighting and energy simulation engines, such as RADIANCE, Daysim, EnergyPlus and OpenStudio.

Soon after, Chris came on board to help move Ladybug move to the next phase of its development. While using Ladybug and Honeybee for his thesis at MIT, he started to add comfort models to Ladybug and Honeybee, which provided the basis for the current comfort tools in Honeybee. From this start, Chris then further developed multiple components, becoming one of the lead developers of Ladybug Tools.

In 2017, with support from Theodore, Mostapha released the Butterfly plugin to add Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to Ladybug Tools by connecting Grasshopper and Dynamo to OpenFOAM.

We are currently in the process of integrating Ladybug Tools into more analysis engines such as THERM (Honeybee), Envimet and CitySim (soon to be released Dragonfly), developing Ladybug Tools for web and re-writing Ladybug Tools to provide them both as Python libraries and plugins for Grasshopper and Dynamo.

Throughout this time, many developers tirelessly contributed to the community in many ways. As a result of their efforts, Ladybug Tools has grown into multiple inter-connected libraries and plugins that are used in academia as well as architecture and engineering offices worldwide. They allow for a wide range of analyses from climate visualization to computational fluid dynamics and have changed the face of environmental building design as a result of their usage. The development and community of Ladybug Tools is ever growing and we are excited for the infinite possibilities that exists for the future!
